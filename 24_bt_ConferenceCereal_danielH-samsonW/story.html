        Sir was thinking about Adam and Eve again. Adam was sinful with red toes and pretty fingers. <br> <br>

Sir walked over to the window and reflected on his scary surroundings. He had always loved Stuyvesant with its mighty, moaning mountains. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel active. <br> <br> 

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the intelligent figure of Adam and Eve. <br> <br> 

The hail pounded like chatting rabbits, making Sir angry. Sir grabbed a giant blade that had been strewn nearby; he massaged it with his fingers. <br> <br> 

As Sir stepped outside and Adam came closer, he could see the damp glint in his eye. <br> <br> 

"I am here because I want an apple," Adam bellowed, in a witty tone. He slammed his fist against Sir's chest, with the force of 9589 bears. "I frigging love you, Sir ."<br> <br> 

Sir looked back, even more angry and still fingering the giant blade. "Adam, I love you," he replied.<br> <br> 

They looked at each other with shocked feelings, like two knobby, kindly koalas plotting at a very mean bar mitzvah, which had Taylor Swift music playing in the background and two hopeful uncles partying to the beat.<br> <br> 

Sir studied Adam's red toes and pretty fingers. Eventually, he took a deep breath. "I'm sorry, but I can't give you an apple," he explained, in pitying tones.<br> <br> 

Adam looked delighted, his body raw like a terrible, talented torch.<br> <br> 

Sir could actually hear Adam's body shatter into 5449 pieces. Then he hurried away into the distance.<br> <br> 

Not even a glass of brandy would calm Sir's nerves tonight.<br> <br> 

THE END

        <h1 class="text-center">Doggo</h1>
        <h6 class="text-center">(randomly generated)</h6>  <br> 
        Doggo the duck was swimming around his pond, feeling a little bit nervous. <br> <br> He had been counting down the days until his 16th birthday, when he would finally transform into a mermaid.<br> <br> 
        He had heard stories from the older ducks in his flock about the day they turned 16, and how they became a part of the magical mermaid kingdom. <br> <br> Doggo was excited and scared at the same time. <br> <br> He had always wanted to be a mermaid, but he was unsure of what it would mean for him.<br> <br> 
        As the day of his transformation neared, Doggo grew more and more nervous.<br> <br>  He tried to talk to his family and friends about it, but none of them seemed to understand what he was going through.<br> <br>
