Predictions:
*.html files will display like normal
*foo without the extension will display plain text

DISCO:
*When trying to access foo through localhost:5000/static/foo we are prompted to download a file named foo. Prediction was wrong.
*When trying to access foo.html through localhost:5000/static/foo.html we get a white page with text
*Apparently you don't need a <body> in the html file to display text on a site
*When trying to access the dir static through localhost:5000/static no site exists
*Wrapping text in  <!-- --> will make it a comment in an html file
*When we put our fixie.html in the parent dir of static, localhost:5000/fixie.html does not work
*When we put fixie.html in a new test folder named 'test', going into localhost:5000/test/fixie.html does not work
*When we change the route to /static/fixie.html, No habo queso replaces the contents in fixie.html that we had orignally
*When we added <!DOCTYPE html><html></html> to foo without the extension, the web browser still asks us to download foo

QCC:
*Is there a way to access a dir from the website. Ex: localhost:5000/dir_name
*Is static a special dir that Flask looks for when running?
