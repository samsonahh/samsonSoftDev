DISCO: 
    rsplit() splits the element from the right, and you can add another argument to determine how many times to split.
    random.choices() can be used to choose from a weighted list. The second argument sets the weights for each of the corresponding elements in the first list.
QCC:
    We still have to test if the weighted choices are chosen with the correct weights.
